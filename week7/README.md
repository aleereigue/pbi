#### Tasks for this Week

On Tuesday, we will learn some network basics and take a tour of different kinds of biological network using some real world research examples.

:white_check_mark: keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the course notebooks.

:white_check_mark: have a go at the new [week 7 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/Z0_VIJPP) in the GitHub Classroom, this one is for you to practice building a simple netwrok in Python using the NetworkX package.

On Thursday I will be working through two notebooks using a NetworkX to build and analyse data. The second notebook will be using some real world data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that was used by us as part of a workshop at an international conference in 2024.

:white_check_mark:  If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
