## Welcome to the PBI course for 2025

#### Tasks for this Week

:white_check_mark: If you haven't [completed the tasks from week 0](https://github.com/biomedical-informatics/pbi/blob/initial-release/week0/README.md) please do so this week.

On Tuesday, I will go through VSCode, Noteable, environments and using GitHub with the course, following that please:

:white_check_mark: familiarise yourselves with VSCode whether that's as a standalone on your laptop/desktop or whether you access it through the Noteable service (you are of course allowed to setup whatever coding environment you like)

:white_check_mark: experiment with setting up either conda or venv virtual environments for python and installing pacakges

:white_check_mark: practice using GitHub; the week 0 assignment gives you a basic introduction but the familiarity will help you unlock a lot of it's useful features.

On Thursday we will be working with some notebooks; these are already in this week's folder on GitHub.

:white_check_mark:  If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.
