#### Tasks for this Week

:white_check_mark: If you haven't completed the tasks from weeks 0 and 1 please do so this week.

On Tuesday, I will take you through a tour of data sources that are widely used in biomedical and clinical data science, run the code from last week, and introduce bulk FTP and API based querying & download.

:white_check_mark: keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the notebooks accompanying each week's work.

:white_check_mark: have a go at the new [week 2 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/oVXQjqAz) in the GitHub Classroom. Remember these are not assessed, they are for you to practice related coding as the course progresses.

On Thursday I will be working through two notebooks and some code snippets focussed around querying and retreiving data and some summary anakysis. These are all included in this week's folder on the course GitHub.

:white_check_mark:  If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
