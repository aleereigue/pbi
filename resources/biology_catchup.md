#### Guidance for students without a background in Biology

It is very common for students with either no or little recent background knowledge in biological and biomedical science to take PBI and the two computational courses that we ran for c.15 years; Bioinformatics 1 and Bioinformatics 2.

We don't expect students to catch up on many years of study in biology in a single 10 credit course. Most of the content in this course is focussed on programming rather than biology. However, we do introduce the fundamentals that you need to follow the course and whenever more specialist knowledge is needed we include that in the relevant lectures and associated reading materials and references.

However, we have found it helpful to signpost some classic reference textbooks where students can look up and read more about some of these topics where they would like to do so. Below are a select list of resources that you could work with to build up your background knowledge if you would like to. All of these are available through the University e-library so you don't need to buy any books (unless you want to of course).
