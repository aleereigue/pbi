#### Tasks for this Week

On Tuesday, we will briefly go over the script/strategy for eUtilities use then move on to introduce ways to query and retrieve data from the biomedical literature database PubMed. This will also use some new biopython and NCBI eUtilities API endpoints. Search strategies are crucial go effectively working with PubMed so we will spend some time going through some useful resrouces and tips.

:white_check_mark: keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the notebooks accompanying each week's work.

:white_check_mark: have a go at the new [week 4 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/-g6LI8cG) in the GitHub Classroom. Remember these are not assessed, they are for you to practice related coding as the course progresses.

:white_check_mark: I have decided to include the solution for the week3 optional assignment from GitHub Classroom right away this week which we will go through on Thursday

On Thursday I will be working through two notebooks building more complex PubMed eUtilities cases. These are all included in this week's folder on the course GitHub.

:white_check_mark:  If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
