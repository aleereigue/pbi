### Coding Environment

There are a few choices for how you might want to do your coding during the course. Please do ask in the discussion boards if you need any help setting these up.

- [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login) - The simplest, and one that requires very little setup. This is the University JupyterLab instance you can pull this GitHub directly in and start coding straight away
- [Local Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) - you can install a version of Jupyter locally using systems like [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). There is a good guide to installing Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
- [VisualStudioCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - This is a free open-source coding IDE from Microsoft. It's excellent and what I would recommend, not least because it has a large number of extensions that make life easier especially for GitHub and Co-Pilot.

We have prepared a [Python introductory mini course](https://github.com/tisimpson/pbi/tree/main/python_basics) in case this is useful to people to brush up on some Python basics.

*Note that materials will be added to this GitHub as the course progresses*
